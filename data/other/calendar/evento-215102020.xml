    <contents>&lt;p&gt;About&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&lt;p&gt;A card is a flexible and extensible content container. It includes options for headers and footers, a wide variety of content, contextual background colors, and powerful display options. If youâ€™re familiar with Bootstrap 3, cards replace our old panels, wells, and thumbnails. Similar functionality to those components is available as modifier classes for cards.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
